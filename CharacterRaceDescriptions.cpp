std::string Human::description =
"Humans are a short-lived race, but diverse and resilient. " 
"They are larger and usually stronger than elves, dwarves, and gnomes, "
"and despite their short lifespans-or perhaps because of them- "
"humans are swift to learn and adapt. "
"Human skin ranges in color from a dark brown, through red "
"and gold tones, and to a fair - skinned pink. Hair tends to be "
"black, brown, or blonde, with red uncommon and gray or white "
"generally a sign of advanced age.";

std::string Orcs::description =
"Orcs are the largest and most physically powerful of the civilized "
"races, even larger and stronger than humans, on average. Their "
"lifespans, however, are brief by the standards of the other races. "
"Orcs have strong jawlines and pronounced tusk - like teeth. "
"Their skin ranges through gray, green and brown tones, with hair "
"almost universally black.";

std::string Dwarf::description =
"Dwarves are short of stature but stocky of build, with powerful "
"muscles despite their small size.They seem to age only a little "
"more slowly than humans, but once they reach their gray - haired "
"old age, they can remain fit and vigorous for over a century. "
"Dwarven skin tones range from a dark slate - gray through as "
"fair as alabaster. Their hair and beards-for dwarves are often "
"very proud of their beards—tend to be black, brown, or copperred, turning white with age.";

std::string Elf::description =
"Elves are graceful, beautiful beings that are so long lived some "
"believe them to be immortal. They maintain their beauty "
"throughout their lives and often manage to combine ancient "
"wisdom and youthful mirth. "
"Elven coloration varies widely by tribe. While many elves cover "
"the same span of skin and hair colors found among humans or "
"dwarves, more exotic blue, green, purpleand other colors are "
"not unheard of.";

std::string Gnome::description =
"Gnomes are the smallest of the civilized races, even shorter than "
"dwarves and much more slight of build. They are longer lived "
"than humans, but not so much as dwarves or elves. "
"Gnomes tend to have ruddy, wholesome complexions in warm "
"brown tones, with warm brown or red hair. ";

std::string Catfolk::description =
"Catfolk are small in number but spread far across the world. "
"They have so many physical similarities to cats that some believe "
"them to be closely related, an assertion that most catfolk fnd "
"insulting. Catfolk are agile, and their senses and claws are sharp. "
"Catfolk are covered in fur that varies widely in length, "
"coloration, and pattern. They have catlike muzzles, eyes, tails, "
"and large, fur - covered ears. Their hands and feet both sport "
"retractable claws, which catfolk are adept at using as both tools "
"and weapons. Catfolk tend to be shorter lived than humans.";
